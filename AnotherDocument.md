## A Science Fiction Plot
### by Arcanyx


A long, long time ago in an awesome, awesome galaxy...

After leaving the icy planet Mars, a group of ghosts fly toward a distant speck. The speck gradually resolves into a fake, space skyscraper.

Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Kathy Lynch, a cold gremlin capable of burglary and even drugs.

Terrified, a passionate gnome known as Amy Hunt flees the Empire, with her protector, Billy Stark.

They head for Chicago on the planet Saturn. When they finally arrive, a fight breaks out. Stark uses his awesome rifle to defend Amy.

Stark and Gnome Amy decide it's time to leave Saturn and steal a tandem to shoot their way out.

They encounter a tribe of wizards. Stark is attacked and the gnome is captured by the wizards and taken back to Chicago.

Stark must fight to save Gnome Amy but when he accidentally unearths a blonde teapot, the entire future of the awesome, icy galaxy is at stake.
